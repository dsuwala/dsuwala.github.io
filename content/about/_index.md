<!-- I'm a Computational Physics Master with interests in computational biology and chemistry. Especially development of new pharmaceuticals. 
I want to develop in the field of drug discovery and be part of this discipline in the future. What drives me is the belief that through science we can make world a better place. I want to be part of such process.
I am specializing in computational science as I think it the best way to guide transition of ideas between research-stage and commercial stage. My experience covers more than computational biology only which I think is an advantage for creative problem solving. -->
Hello! I'm a Computational Physics Master with interests in computational biology and chemistry. I am 
specializing in computational science as I think it the best way to guide transition of ideas 
between research-stage and commercial stage.\
My experience covers various topics within research which includes also developement of various 
python (and not only) tools. With academic research comes also another thing. We need to frequently learn 
new tools or develop them to suit out needs. This gives a lot of versatility, because you start to develop how to 
transfer what you know into different areas.\
Outside of research and programing, I am huge fan of Dune books by Frank Herbert, a stellaris game player and a hobbyst 
birdwatcher (crows and magpies are totaly awesome!).
