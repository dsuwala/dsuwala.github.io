## Summary 
This project consists of c++ implementation of an equation's solver which is exported to python. In this 
case the equations 
describes a system which you obtain when you mix two substances which are simoultaneously 
spreading and reacting with itself. In physics literature this particular system implemented here
is calles the Gray-Scott model. The physical background is in great details described 
[here](https://itp.uni-frankfurt.de/~gros/StudentProjects/Projects_2020/projekt_schulz_kaefer/).
It turns out that such systems exhibit formations of some patterns. Belowe are some examples:

If you want to learn more about parameters I used, the code repository is
[here](https://github.com/dsuwala/reactionDifussion/tree/main). You can find parameters 
in main python file.
